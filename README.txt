What is SocialVibe?

SocialVibe is a social media tool that helps people to spread the word about charitable causes online. SocialVibe keep in touch with a variety of charities like WWF and The World Food Programme. They offer tools to help you spread the word and attract more users to their site through you, which in turn earns more money for your Cause. Your Cause can also be sponsored by an advertisement group which gives you more points. The more collective points a cause has, the more donations it is likely to receive.
